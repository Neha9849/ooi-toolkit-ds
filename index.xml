Data governance is defined as a collection of processes, roles, policies, standards and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information. Good data governance establishes processes and responsibilities ensuring data quality and security. Essentially, data governance defines who can act on the data, upon what data, in which situations and with what methods.

This is typically one of the most time-consuming aspects of the data science process. Any decisions made by the data scientist in the data pre-processing stage can have important impacts in subsequent model development and, even, deployment stages. Therefore, it is important to document analytical decisions made in this stage, whether in the code or through a documenting tool, to trace the lineage of the data from the original data source, when the data is in its raw form, to the model training and development stage.</description></item><item><title>Data Quality</title><link>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/04-data-collection-processing/data-quality.en.adoc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/04-data-collection-processing/data-quality.en.adoc/</guid><description>Data quality is a critical concern for AI projects. Poor data quality can bias prediction results and mislead users. There are six key areas of data quality:
Accuracy: how well does the data reflect reality?
Completeness: is the data comprehensive or not missing value entries in unexpected instances?
Consistency: does information stored in one place match the information stored in another place?
Timeliness: is data available when needed?
Validity: is data in a specific format?</description></item><item><title>Feature Engineering</title><link>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/04-data-collection-processing/feature-engineering.en.adoc-copy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/04-data-collection-processing/feature-engineering.en.adoc-copy/</guid><description>Feature engineering is related to data pre-processing but is more closely related to the modeling process. Feature engineering refers to when model inputs or features are generated that are then incorporated into a model for training. Typically, this means adjusting and reworking the predictors to enable models to better uncover predictor-response relationships. The engineering involves the steps taken to improve model performance by generating the appropriate features. Since we may not know in advance what adjustments or re-adjustments of the features are required to improve model performance, the re-working of predictors can be experimental in nature requiring experience and tools to find predictor representations.</description></item><item><title>Missing Data</title><link>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/04-data-collection-processing/missing-data.en.adoc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/04-data-collection-processing/missing-data.en.adoc/</guid><description>Handling missing values can be a component of data pre-processing as well as feature engineering. Missing values can occur for several reasons including structural deficiencies in the data (namely, deliberate omission in the data collection or data generating process), random occurrences, or specific reasons.
A structural deficiency would be the case of a missing component of a predictor omitted from the data. Typically, these cases could be resolved once the necessary component is identified.</description></item><item><title>What if we don’t have the right data to solve the problem?</title><link>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/03-scoping/what-if-we-dont-have-the-right-data.adoc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/03-scoping/what-if-we-dont-have-the-right-data.adoc/</guid><description>This has to do with inherent limitations that may exist in the information collected. At some point, no technology or analysis will help you further. Considering whether the right data exists is critical at the early project stage. You may want to create contingencies to pivot towards collecting better data to answer the question. Or, if the data simply does not exist or is impractical to collect, revert to the original question of interest and redefine the project scope.</description></item><item><title>What if we don’t like the results?</title><link>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/03-scoping/what-if-we-dont-like-the-results.adoc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/03-scoping/what-if-we-dont-like-the-results.adoc/</guid><description>This is when the results of the project are not those anticipated by the end user. This can be a function of not having the right data, poor model inputs or poor model predictions in specific scenarios. The possibility that the project might lead to poor results should be discussed among the project stakeholders. This addresses differences in how individuals might accept the results of the project and reveal inherent biases individuals might have.</description></item><item><title>When is the project over?</title><link>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/03-scoping/when-is-the-project-over.adoc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/03-scoping/when-is-the-project-over.adoc/</guid><description>This is about aligning expectations and gets to why the project was initiated in the first place. Think about what the final deliverable is and work iteratively backward. Gather stakeholder input and identify reasons the project could end. Setting aside obvious failures, such as lack of funding or losing interest, focus should be on the needs to be delivered and how to conclude the project. Many projects will require ongoing support and maintenance, but this should be clarified up front.</description></item><item><title>Who does the problem affect?</title><link>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/03-scoping/who-does-the-problem-affect.adoc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/03-scoping/who-does-the-problem-affect.adoc/</guid><description>This is about identifying the end users. Identify the people who will be affected by the problem and incorporate them into the discussion of problem articulation. This can mean small group or focus group discussions if they are representative of a larger group of people. Understand how these people will be affected by the project. One approach to think about this is to have a solution trial run. Assuming you can answer the problem, ask yourself if you can use the answer and whose life will change as a result.</description></item><item><title>Why is the problem important?</title><link>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/03-scoping/why-is-the-problem-important.en.adoc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://unicef.github.io/ooi-toolkit-ds/03-scoping/why-is-the-problem-important.en.adoc/</guid><description>This section is about problem definition. This sets the expectations for why a project should be undertaken in the first place. Identifying the importance of the problem before starting will help optimize how company resources are used. Relatedly, you will want to answer:
Why does this problem matter? Is this a new problem or has it been solved already? In this effort, you will want to engage with the different collaborators, both technical and non-technical, to understand how each person sees the problem.</description></item></channel></rss>
